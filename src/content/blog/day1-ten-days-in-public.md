Day #1 of #10-days-in-public; I worked on my website and added a new feature to my bag scanner tool (kinda evolved into a slack toolkit).

For the bag scanner tool I added the ability to search for a user in hackclub by name and get data about them; one annoying thing about that project is that since it works with a 58.3mb file its a pain to load into an editor.
