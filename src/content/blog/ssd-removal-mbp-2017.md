# Blade SSD removal MBP 2017

Hi! I've had a macbook pro 2017 for about a year now and I got it used; its been great so far until one day after updating it just refused to turn on i'm not entirely sure why this happened but i replced the battery and that did't solve the issue so yeah ^_^  

I eventualy decided to just try and remove the ssd from the macbook and see if there was a way to recover any files from it (spoiler: there kinda is but its annoying) but I couldn't find any guide online and iFixit had nothing. I decided to just try and yolo it and see if I could figre it out on my own and suprisngly I actualy managed to do it and discovered the process wasn't that hard! I'll take you through the steps I took so that if you want to do this its much less of a hassle.

## Guide

1. the first thing you need to do is to remove the screws from the back of your macbook. This will use a P5 Pentalobe driver which I belive you can buy from iFixit as well as several other companies on amazon.

2. next you need to crack open the shell of the macbook by prying under the front (on the side where the macbook opens). It's pretty helpful to have a suction cup or something to lift it up a bit so you can get your prying tool underneath (i used a flat plastic prying tool i got from the battery repair kit for this macbook but a guitar pick or credit card would probly also work)

3. now once you've got the back slightly opened up just run around the edge of the shell prying up on it until the front and two sides are free then just pull forward at a slight (15ish degree?) angle and it should slide right out.

4. once its open locate the silver metal block looking thing; this is your ssd

5. now using a T5 Torx driver (couldn't you just use one type of screws apple ðŸ˜­; be more like framework) you need to unscrew the two screws on either side of the front of the ssd

6. now comes the slightly scary part (for me at least) you need to lift up the black tape thats covering the top of the ssd (don't worry the ssd will be fine)

7. now just slightly pull on the ssd (again at a slight angle) and it should pop right out!

## Postlog and notes

I hope this helped if you are trying to do this your self! Now for recovering the data the two options i've found are a) buy a seconday macbook of the exact same generation and model and swap your ssd in or b) pay some data recovery company alot of money to probly do the same thing for you; neither option is super appealing to me so i'll keep searching for alernatives and i'll update this article if I do find any. As of today though (August 3th 2024) i haven't be able to get a hold of another macbook or adaptor to connect this to my computer but if you do find one definetly leave a comment on the hacker news post linked below!
