# Blade SSD removal MBP 2017

Hi! I've had a macbook pro 2017 for about a year now and I got it used; its been great so far until one day after updating it just refused to turn on i'm not entirely sure why this happened but i replced the battery and that did't solve the issue so yeah ^_^  

I eventualy decided to just try and remove the ssd from the macbook and see if there was a way to recover any files from it (spoiler: there kinda is but its annoying) but I couldn't find any guide online and iFixit had nothing. I decided to just try and yolo it and see if I could figre it out on my own and suprisngly I actualy managed to do it and discovered the process wasn't that hard! I'll take you through the steps I took so that if you want to do this its much less of a hassle.
