[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a6f714aa-10c4-443a-8b98-c9d687227961/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/funny-empanada-9407a1/deploys)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where I like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The content of the blog posts is fetched from [Vrite](https://vrite.io/), where it is written and stored, and used to build the flat files that are deployed to netlify.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
